# Context:

The startup Pur Beurre Works is familiar with French eating habits. Their restaurant, Ratatouille, is gaining increasing success and is always attracting more visitors to the hill of Montmartre.

The team noticed that their users wanted to change their diet but were not sure where to start. Replace Nutella with a hazelnut paste, yes, but which one? And in which store to buy it? Their idea is therefore to create a program that would interact with the Open Food Facts database to recover the food, compare it and offer the user a healthier substitute for the food they want.
